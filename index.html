                                    <br>
                                    Human papillomaviruses (HPVs) are a group of more than 100 types of viruses that are the most common sexually transmitted infections in the United States. Nearly 80 million Americans—about one in four—are currently infected with HPVs. It is estimated that around 14 million people, including teenagers, will become newly infected each year. 
                                    <br><br>
                                    Some types of HPVs can cause serious health problems including certain kinds of cancers (e.g., cervical cancer, anal cancer, and oropharyngeal cancers). Research has identified that almost 100% of cervical cases are caused by HPVs. About 26.8% of women in the US are infected with HPVs; of those, most have certain types of HPVs that cause cervical cancer.

                                    <p><b>Who gets HPV infections?</b>
                                    <br>
                                    Anyone who has ever been sexually active (that is, engaged in skin-to-skin sexual conduct, including vaginal, anal, or oral sex) can get HPVs. HPV infection is most common in people in their late teens and early 20s. Almost 45% of 20-24 years-old people get infected with HPVs, while under 30% of people in other age groups get infected.
                                    <br><br>
                                    HPV is easily passed between partners through sexual contact. HPV infections are more likely in those who have had many sex partners or have had sex with someone who has had many partners. The risk of getting HPVs for people who have not had any sexual partners is 5.2%; for those who have had one sexual partner is 11.5%; people who have had two sexual partners have a risk of 24.3%; those who have had 3-5 sexual partners have a risk of 32.0%; and those who have 6 and more sexual partners is 35.3%.

                                    <b>How can I prevent HPV inflections?</b><br>
                                    HPV vaccines are highly effective in preventing the targeted HPV types. Three vaccines (Cervarix, Gardasil, and Gardasil 9) have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent HPV infection, and results of clinical trials have demonstrated high efficacy (about 95%) of these vaccines. All three HPV vaccines are licensed for females and males through age 26.

                                Health insurance plans cover the cost of HPV vaccines. If you don't have insurance, the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program may be able to help.
